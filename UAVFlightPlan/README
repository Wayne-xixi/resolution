UAV Flight Plan README. v 0.1.0

- Basic functions for managing UAV navigation files:
               - Earth Location. Defines an earth location in terms of altitude, longitude and latitude.
               - UAVWaypoint. Extends Earth Location adding altitude from the ground level, distance to next waypoint and heading to the next waypoint.
               - UAVFlightPlan. Extends a std::list of UAVWaypoint and can load UAVNavigation flight plans. Also it can export to kml data, handled by Google Earth.
               - UAVTrajectory. Extends a vector of earth location and can load UAVNavigation text logs that only contains the position data. Also, it can export to kml files.


Also it builds the following utilities and unit tests:

   - create obstacles. Creates KML obstacles of circular shape.
   - cut. Cuts a log specifing the initial and final samples.
   - distance. Calculates the distance over the time between to UAV Navigation logs. Exports the result into a MATLAB file.
   - fp2kml. Converts UAV Navigation flight plan files into kml files
   - test_earth_location. Unit tests in order to check the proper behaviour of the class.
   - uav2kml. Converts UAV Navigation log text files that only contain position data into kml files
   - uavs_sample. Translates a log into a log with constant sample time.

The autor does not give any warranty of correct functionality, so please be my beta tester!!
