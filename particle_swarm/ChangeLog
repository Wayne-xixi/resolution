ChangeLog of Simple Particle Swarm Library v0.1.0

11-06-14 Ended the implementation and the debug phases. Tested a preliminary executable whose goal is to minimize the
         distance to a vector (5, 5, 5) in a world whose limits are (0, 0, 0) and (10, 10 , 10).

11-06-10 Started the implementation of Particle Swarm Optimizator. In the first design, the goal is to minimize a real
         function with real vectors as input.
