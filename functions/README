----------- Common Functions readme v0.1.2 ------------

This library is intended to have some classes and functions that I consider basic.

Below the main functionality of each class is given.
   
   - ArgumentData: basic class that explores the arguments given to an executable. 
   - DecMinSec: stores an angle in terms of degrees, minutes and seconds. Can represent it in a variety of ways.
   - Point3D: a 3D cartesian point.
   - HessianPlane: stores the definition of a plane in terms of normal vector and distance to the origin.
   - RandomNumberGenerator: uses boost in order to generate random numbers
   - funcions.cpp: This file has many common purpose methods such as importing/exporting MATLAB vectors and matrices.
   - RealVector.h (and .cpp): this class extends the funcionality of std::vector<double> by adding vector operations such
     as sum, substract, multiplication by a scalar number, scalar product of two vectors of any dimension and cross product of two tridimensional vectors, calculate the norm, normalize a vector, and many others.
   - DegMinSec --> class created in order to work with angles in degrees (useful when dealing with GPS data)

Also, it builds some executables:

   - function_test. Is intended to be the unit test of each class.

The autor does not give any warranty of correct functionality, so please be my beta tester!!
