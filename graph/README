Feb 2011 (v.0.1.1)

-- Added symmetric graphs support (each call to addEdge adds two edges). Tested!

Jan 2011

-- Implements a template graph class that stores template Vertices and its edges can store data too.
-- Uses STL (std::list and std::map)
-- Uses adjacency list implementation (good with non-dense graphs)
-- Add vertices and edges easily. Removal is not considered!
-- Included a method that performs depth first search in the graph.
-- toString method to easily debug and represent data
-- Basic functionality test included
