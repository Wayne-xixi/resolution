Sparser library v. 0.1.7 (experimental)

2011-10-27 	Added inverse functionality. That is, the ParseBlock class can publish its content via << operator
		and it is done in a way that is compatible in order to read it again with this library.

2011-05-27  Fixed some more const stuff in ParseProperty

2011-05-25	Fixed some error while loading files in StringUtil. It did not throw exceptions if the file was not found.

2011-05-24 	Fixed some problems with const clauses.

2011-05-23 	Implemented the specialization of vector of double

2011-02-07      Possible segfault in the constructor fixed.

2010-04-08      Revised compatibility with boost 1.40 and gcc-4.4.1  

2009-04-22 	David Alejo. Added the destructors of Checker, ParseBlock and ParseContext 
						in order to avoid memory leaks.
						
2009-04-23	Implemented the copy contructor of ParseBlock and the Clone functions of the Check subclasses.
						This will prevent double frees and make possible to copy Parseblock and Checker classes.
						
2009-04-23	Solved a subtle bug when calling to hasProperty and hasBlocks methods of Parseblock class.
						There were created some uncomplete map entries that made the destructor crash. It was solved by changing
						the call to the overloaded [] operator to the find function.
